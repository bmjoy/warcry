# The Great War of Atser
The Great War of Atser is a real-time fantasy strategy game heavily influenced by Warcraft: Orcs and Humans with the unique goal to reform the very basis of a genre by revisiting the game that founded it.

## The fundamentals of a reformed genre
The War of the Ring game-mode of The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II is already very close to the vision itself, but there should be even more emphasis on the real-time battles by completely removing the building and unit-training aspects as they are already faster than real-time. Units should be trained and buildings should be built only if there is no military movement at all. In addition the number of units to be trained should be very limited.
Ultimately, the elements of strategy should get the most focus, by allowing the players to use them in different ways to acquire victory.

### Attrition warfare
This is the way of war most real-time strategy games are forcing on the player. It needs to be there, but its counter-part should get the same-level of attention.

### Maneuver warfare
In maneuver warfare, the destruction of certain enemy targets is combined with isolation of enemy forces and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses by movement.

#### Command centers
Factions are required to have a designated center of command at all times. By default this would be the town hall, but there is an option to move it to another building or cave and keep the town hall as a fake command center as a deception. The opposing faction's primary goal will be to find this command center with spies, magic, or total annihilation of the base to crush the head of the enemy and scatter their forces.

## Origin of the name
The primary goal of the name selection is to pay on homage to the world of Azeroth. The original name that inspired the name, Azeroth, is one of the locations that the Israelites stopped at during their forty years of wandering in the wilderness, Hazeroth, a place in the wilderness. Its transliteration is Chatseroth, that is originated from the word Chatser, meaning settlement, village. By omitting the beginning of the word the same way Blizzard did, but keeping the orginal trasliteration, we get Atser, the name of our Azeroth-inspired brand new world.
