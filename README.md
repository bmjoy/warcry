# Warcry: Clans and Kingdoms
Warcry: Clans and Kingdoms is a open source real-time fantasy strategy game heavily influenced by Warcraft: Orcs and Humans with the unique goal to reform the very basis of a genre by revisiting the game that founded it.

## Fundamentals of a reformed genre
The War of the Ring game-mode of The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II is already very close to the vision itself, but there should be even more emphasis on the real-time battles by completely removing the building and unit-training aspects as they are already faster than real-time. Units should be trained and buildings should be built only if there is no military movement at all. In addition the number of units to be trained should be very limited.

### Elements of strategy
Ultimately, the elements of strategy should get the most focus, by allowing the players to use them in different ways to acquire victory.

#### Attrition warfare
This is the way of war most real-time strategy games are forcing on the player. It needs to be there, but its counter-part should get the same-level of attention.

#### Maneuver warfare
In maneuver warfare, the destruction of certain enemy targets is combined with isolation of enemy forces and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses by movement.

##### Command centers
Factions are required to have a designated center of command at all times. By default this would be the town hall, but there is an option to move it to another building or cave and keep the town hall as a fake command center as a deception. The opposing faction's primary goal will be to find this command center with spies, magic, or total annihilation of the base to crush the head of the enemy and scatter their forces.

##### Leaders

##### Logistical bases

##### Fire support assets

##### Advantage of terrain

##### Double envelopment

##### Ambush

#### Scorched-earth action

#### Blockade

#### Guerilla warfare

#### Deception

#### Feint

### Gameplay aspects of strategy
The real-life elements of strategy should be captured through pure strategical gameplay aspects. [Gabriel Wink's Post Human W.A.R : Developing a game in pursuit of untainted strategy](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/GabrielWink/20171210/311047/Developing_a_game_in_pursuit_of_untainted_strategy.php) will serve as a baseline with slight changes to fit the current need. 

#### Chance
Damages done by the units are fixed, there is no chance of dodging, no unpredictable outcomes to rule out all the non-strategy factors.
However the lack of information is a key aspect of strategy as the elements of strategy clearly shows. So the game won't just keep the unexplored areas, it will also implement the fog of war from the later games of the series and will introduce scouts and spies.  

#### Speed
Sometimes strategic decesion making demands quick thinking and acting. However noticing that the enemy forces are incoming and building a wall before they reach the base or training soldiers during a siege to overcome the enemy are events so surreal that they should never happen in a proper real-time strategy game. Therefore as stated above only unit movement will be real time, but even those will be much slower to require fast reactions only if they are appropriate.

## Building on a legacy

## Origin of the names
The primary goal of the name selections is to pay homage to the names of the original game.

### Warcry: Clans and Kingdoms
The main purpose of the game's title is to be as close to the original as possible to make the connection instantly recognizible, also to be a title that is coming from the franchise itself. Warcry was introduced in Warcraft 3 to add a unique reaction to every unit that has been ordered to attack a hero. Though heroes were only introduced in Warcraft 3, stronger, unique versions of the regular units were already playable in Warcraft 2, and were present as non-playable characters in Warcraft 1. Since similar units will be also added to this game it's a nice way to refer to this new key feature with the title while keeping it close to the original.

The original subtitle was highlighting the playable races, so the new subtitle does the same, but in a more subtle way. Though the orcish clans and the kingdoms of the alliance were introduced only in Warcraft 2, there is no reason some similar variety couldn't be introduced in the current game. Hence the eye-catching reference in the subtitle.

### World of Atser
The original name that inspired the name, Azeroth, is one of the locations that the Israelites stopped at during their forty years of wandering in the wilderness, Hazeroth, a place in the wilderness. Its transliteration is Chatseroth, that is originated from the word Chatser, meaning settlement, village. By omitting the beginning of the word the same way Blizzard did, but keeping the orginal trasliteration, we get Atser, the name of our Azeroth-inspired brand new world.
